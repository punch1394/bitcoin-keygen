**UPDATE :** please don't use this. You should always use a [HD Wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki). This is kept here for historical reasons and as a technical curiosity only.

bitcoin-keygen
==============

Ruby script to generate Bitcoin "brain wallet" from any given STDIN input.

The resulting private key will be written in WIF (Wallet Import Format) to STDOUT.

[Please read the warnings about Brain Wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet#Precaution)

** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK **

Example usage:

```
# Generate wallet from a passphrase
echo -n "Hello World" | bitcoin-keygen
=> 5K5CpQZtUvPqwk2UE1FAiWC1nPV1WYqMnEhMYy2WTiMz3J1u9nm

# Generate wallet from a file with a passphrase in it
echo -n "Hello World" > passphrase.txt
cat passphrase.txt | bitcoin-keygen
=> 5K5CpQZtUvPqwk2UE1FAiWC1nPV1WYqMnEhMYy2WTiMz3J1u9nm

# Generate wallet from an image on disk
cat image1.jpg | bitcoin-keygen
=> 5KQn311se4ZeDDC2o5uwnHLnZhshMNFYs7w57fh2k1oPwwYoN9V

# Generate wallet from a combination of two images on disk
